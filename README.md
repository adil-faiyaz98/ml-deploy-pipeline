## Work in Progress | Stalled 
The respository is not under active development. Some files may be merged in the future but there's a more polished and optimized implementation targeted towards specific machine learning optimizations is being developed that might evolve into a very impactful python library and CLI tool or a production grade system. Feel free to provide your inputs if you're a Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, or MLOps Engineer about the pain points that you experience and what aspects, if taken care of precisely, could make you more productive towards your goals.

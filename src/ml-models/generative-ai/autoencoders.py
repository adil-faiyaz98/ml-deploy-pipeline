# Used for implementing Autoencoders for unsupervised learning tasks.
# This module focuses on encoding and decoding processes to reconstruct the input data.

# Helps in training the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic data.
# This module defines the architecture of the GAN and the training procedure.

# It helps in Anomaly Detection, Image Reconstruction, and Image Generation tasks.
